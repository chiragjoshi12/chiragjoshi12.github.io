For a while now, youâ€™ve probably heard the term "AI" being mentioned everywhere, but it's not always clear what it actually is, right? And why is there so much buzz about it?

AI (Artificial Intelligence), as the name suggests, simply means artificial intelligence. Yes, itâ€™s the intelligence that we humans have had control over for thousands of years. ðŸ˜„ (Though, moving forward, that might not be the case.)

AI refers to a machine that can think, learn, and understand like humans. This means it can perform tasks that typically require human brainpower. (Here, machine refers to computersâ€”not factory or household machines. ðŸ˜Š)

Up until about 70â€“80 years ago, the machines we built were primarily designed to assist us with physical tasks, whether in factories or cars.

But the invention of computers and calculators was the first time we developed a machine that could assist with mental tasks. Early computers were programmed to handle basic calculations, and they followed simple instructions to complete these tasks. Gradually, we began programming computers to handle more complex calculations and tasks using more sophisticated instructions.

This pattern continued: programming computers with more advanced instructions to carry out increasingly complex and challenging tasks. Most mobile apps and software today still follow this approach, such as WhatsApp, accounting software, phone cameras, Zoom, alarm clocks, YouTube, etc. (Although platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and Google also incorporate a bit of AI, they mostly rely on predefined instructions.)

But ultimately, computers were limited to following the instructions we gave them. They couldnâ€™t think for themselves, and only followed what was programmed.

(When I say "computer," Iâ€™m not just referring to PCs. This applies to all digital devices around us, especially mobile phones. ðŸ˜Š)

Now, imagine if a computer or phone could function without being programmed or given specific instructions. What if we could just tell it what to do, and it would understand and act on its own?

That would be pretty close to how a human operates, right? (Though, letâ€™s be honestâ€”some humans struggle to work without instructions too! ðŸ¤ª)

Well, guess what? Weâ€™ve built machines that can think, reason, understand, analyze, and learn just like the human brain. This is what we call AI.

AI is essentially software or computer programs that can think like a smart person. They can respond to questions, write content, create photos and videos, have discussions, and handle any task that requires thinking or creativity.

And thatâ€™s why I keep saying AI is not just some new tool or technologyâ€”itâ€™s the most powerful technology in human history, with the potential to change every aspect of our lives.

In AI language, these programs are called models. Theyâ€™re much more powerful than any software weâ€™ve had before.

Yes, todayâ€™s AI models have limitations. In some areas, theyâ€™re weaker than us humans. But in other areas, theyâ€™re faster, more efficient, and way more creative than we are. Just think of current AI as the starting point. (You can compare it to smartphones from 12 years ago.) If AI is already this capable, imagine how powerful and useful it will become as it continues to evolve!!! ðŸ˜‡

Now, you might wonderâ€”how can a machine think? Our brain is such a complex mystery that even scientists haven't fully figured it out yet, so how are machines thinking?

Iâ€™ll answer this in the next post. Itâ€™s the result of 70 years of hard work, research, and investment. ðŸ˜Š
