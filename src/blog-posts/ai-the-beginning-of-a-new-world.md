AI: The Beginning of a New World!!

Over the past 12 months, the entire world has been buzzing about AI, but why has this happened? And what are the real reasons behind it?

Many people might wonder why all this buzz? Why does everyone need to understand or adopt AI? 🤔 Before we dive into what AI is and how it works, let’s talk about why it’s crucial for everyone to understand AI. 😇 In one sentence: “AI is the most powerful, influential, and dangerous technology/discovery in the entire history of humanity so far.” 😎 Finally, we have created artificial intelligence!

(When we were young, we used to hear elders say that no matter how hard scientists try, it’s impossible to create a brain and blood — that’s something only God can do. 😊) The idea of machines thinking for themselves has been part of our stories and imagination for many years. But creating artificial intelligence was really challenging and uncertain. After 70 years of continuous research, we have now reached this point.

Yes, today’s AI has many flaws and limitations, but this is just the beginning. There are two important points to understand here:

AI can process information millions of times faster than our brains, especially in learning at this speed and improving itself. So, the knowledge and capabilities our brain has gained through millions of years of evolution can be achieved by AI in much less time. Yes, it’s still weak in many tasks, but it’s learning at an extraordinary pace.

Secondly, while it took billions of years to create 8 billion human brains, it takes almost no time to create billions of copies of our artificial intelligence. Now think carefully about how many tasks around us involve active or passive use of our brains? Almost all of them! And that’s why it’s certain that AI’s impact will be widespread in all aspects of our lives. I will write a simple explanation that anyone can understand about AI in my upcoming articles. 😊

(The sole purpose of starting to write articles on AI is to increase general understanding of AI and explore the possibilities that arise from its proper use.) Moreover, it’s essential to steer AI in the right direction in every field. We are actively working on developing AI models in the education sector and steering them in the right direction. We strongly believe that more and more people need to contribute their thoughts and opinions for this purpose. 🙏🙏
