title: Laravel - Resetting some `Input` value

I have recently started working in Laravel 4.2 and I must say it is really well [documented](http://laravel.com/docs). At [Strategic Systems International](http://ssidecisions.com), currently I am a part of the team working at a Large scale Health Care System built on top of Laravel.

Today, I faced an issue in which some wasn't working as required. I looked through the code and sooner, I found out that the problem was due to some unnecessary hidden field that was being submitted along with the form when saving the data. `Input` class was being used throughout the action of controller. Now, I had to reset this unnessary hidden field from the `Input`. Now there were several ways to do so. First option was to reset this hidden field value through Javascript before form submission, but JS might be turned off in userâ€™s browser. Other option was to handle this in the action (function) that was handling the saving process. At first, I thought to do it this way:

```php
// Get all the form data except the hidden field
$data = Input::except('foobar')
// Now use $data instead of Input
```

Considering the size of that action that was handling the saving process, sooner I realized that it would be a bad bad idea to adopt this approach. 

I headed to the [Laravel docs for `Input`](http://laravel.com/docs/requests) but strangely there was nothing that I could find regarding resetting values from the `Input`. I searched through the google and finally found it in the [Laravel 3 docs](http://three.laravel.com/docs/input). Here is how I implemented this:

```php
// Merge the Input array with my custom array.
Input::merge(array( 'foobar' => null ));
```

and that did the trick.
