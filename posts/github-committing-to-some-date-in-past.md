Sometimes it may happen that you might want to commit to some previous date e.g. you did something yesterday and forgot to commit the changes and now you donâ€™t want to make this commit to today but to yesterday. In that case you may use the following

```bash
git commit --date="`date --date='n day ago'`" -am "Commit Message"
```

Here *n* in the *n day ago* is to be replaced with the number of days to in the past and *Commit Message*
is of course the commit message.
