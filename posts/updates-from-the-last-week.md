It has been quite some time since I blogged or contributed to the opensource. I had been quite busy lately and wasn't able to find the time enough to do that. I managed to spare some time this week; enough to polish some of my existing projects and release a few opensource projects.:

- **[Upgrade Released]**<br>
  [Jquery Toast Plugin](http://github.com/kamranahmedse/jquery-toast-plugin) &ndash; Now supports loader over the toasts. [Find the demo here](http://kamranahmed.info)
- **[New Release]**<br>
  [Smasher](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/smasher) &ndash; Lets you easily turn your directory structure to JSON or Array and vice versa.
- **[New Release]**<br>
  [Laraformer](http://github.com/kamranahmedse/laraformer) &ndash; A Laravel 5.* package that lets you easily introduce a transformation layer for your data.
- **[Upgrade Released]**<br>
  [Laravel Censor](http://github.com/kamranahmedse/laravel-censor) &ndash; Now supports wildcards. Now you can specify the words/sentences to redact or replace using wildcards (`%bad`, `%words%` etc) as well.
- **[New Site Design]**<br>
  [kamranahmed.info](http://kamranahmed.info/) &ndash; Have upgraded the design of the site to support mobile devices and make it more clean

Also, an article titled *ES6 Succinctly* is in writing and will hopefully be published today or tomorrow. Stay tuned!
