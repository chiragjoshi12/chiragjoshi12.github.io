While working with any version control system such as `git` it is quite possible that you or anyone in the team that you are working with accidentally commit an unnecessary large sized file and nobody notices until too long when *hundreds* of commits have been made and deleting that large-sized file alone from the latest commit wouldn't matter much. That file must be removed completely from the commits history.
