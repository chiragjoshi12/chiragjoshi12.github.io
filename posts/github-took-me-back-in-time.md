Today, when I visited github in order to check [my profile](http://github.com/kamranahmedse), I notice this bug in the heatmap that is shown on the user's profile ..github had took me back in time to **January 4, 2014**. Seems like a bug with the graph that caused it to cycle back to the start of January 2014 after December 2014, while it should have been January 2015.

However, I have reported the issue to Github.
